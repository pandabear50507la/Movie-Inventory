# Movie-Inventory
Allows you basic functionalities of making an inventory of your plex MOVIES only.

In order for the to work you must acquire an API key from http://www.omdbapi.com/. It takes literally two seconds. Once you have acquired the API key, please add it in the omdb_utils file in the utils section. inside the file it is the third line down labeled "OMDB_API_KEY = 'INSERT KEY HERE'" replace INSERT KEY HERE with your api key that you got in your email to get this up and running. Just click on main.py once all of this is done and you should be able to get this running. 

Please feel free to fork this whenever you like.
